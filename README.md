# Design Pattern
The app is built with the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is its structural design pattern that separates objects into three distinct groups:
- View: The view is responsible for defining the structure, layout, and appearance of what the user sees on screen.
- Model: Model classes are non-visual classes that encapsulate the app's data.
- ViewModel: The view model implements properties and commands to which the view can data bind to, and notifies the view of any state changes through change notification events.
